# Linear Algebra for Embeddings and Similarity Calculations

This repository contains an educational and practical notebook that explores **Linear Algebra concepts** and their application in **embedding similarity computations**, commonly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP), recommendation systems, and other AI/ML tasks.

## 📘 About the Project

The goal of this project is to connect theoretical knowledge of Linear Algebra with real-world applications, particularly in the context of **similarity calculations using embeddings** (e.g., cosine similarity).

This notebook was designed for learners who want to strengthen their understanding of:

- Core linear algebra concepts
- Vectors and matrices
- Dot products and norms
- Cosine similarity
- Practical embedding examples

The explanations are written in an intuitive and beginner-friendly way, with code examples using Python and visualizations powered by libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib.

## 🔍 Topics Covered

- Vector spaces and dimensions  
- Matrix operations and transformations  
- Norms and unit vectors  
- Dot product and geometric interpretation  
- Cosine similarity formula and usage  
- Practical example: comparing word or sentence embeddings

## 💡 Use Case: Embedding Similarity

The notebook demonstrates how linear algebra is foundational for comparing high-dimensional vectors, such as word or sentence embeddings generated by language models. These comparisons are key in tasks such as:

- Information retrieval
- Text similarity
- Semantic search
- Recommendation systems

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  (google colab)
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- [Optional] Scikit-learn, Transformers (if applicable in advanced examples)
